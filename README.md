# VUTTR (Very Useful Tools to Remember)

## Implementation
This repository contains a VUTTR (Very Useful Tools to Remember) application.
The information is stored in a Database.
The application is secured based on OAuth2 protocol, in order to ensure a minimum data security.
Thus, the application user should register and sign in into the application to consult the stored information.

For testing purposes, it uses H2 Database, which may be easily replaced for production uses.
If changing the Database, Flyway migrations should be adjusted.

Full documentation can be seen at `http://localhost:3000/swagger-ui.html`

## Endpoints

- [GET] `/tools/filter?search=XX&tags=true` returns all tools (if no filter) or the tools list filtered according to `search` and `tags` params.
- [POST] `/tools` adds a new tool
- [DELETE] `/tools/:id` remove tool by ID

- [POST] `/user` adds a new user
- [POST] `/oauth/token` sign in the application
